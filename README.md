# Mautic developer documentation (new)

This repository hosts the new developer documentation for Mautic on the [Read the Docs platform](https://readthedocs.org/). Whenever a PR is merged, changes are deployed immediately to https://mautic-developer.readthedocs.io/

If you're looking for our legacy developer documentation, please go to https://developer.mautic.org/ or the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mautic/developer-documentation).

## Migration of developer docs to Read the Docs

We aim to move all aspects of the developer documentation to Read the Docs (with the exception of the REST API documentation).
In the video below, [@dennisameling](https://github.com/dennisameling) explains how the documentation is currently structured and briefly touches upon current limitations we're running into.

For more background, our end goal, and to let us know if you want to help, please check out [this issue](https://github.com/mautic/developer-documentation-new/issues/2). Thanks in advance!
